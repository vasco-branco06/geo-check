# Validation

What this document is: the evidence that `geo-check` does what it says. Not a
study of the web. Every number here is about the tool.

The completion figures were measured 2026-08-31 and the agreement figures
2026-09-06, against the agent list as it stood on each date. The aggregation
scripts are [scripts/run_study.py](../scripts/run_study.py) and
[scripts/verify_accuracy.py](../scripts/verify_accuracy.py), and both run offline
against recorded responses, so this is reproducible rather than remembered.

## It survives the real web

906 real sites, recorded and replayed.

| | Sites |
| --- | ---: |
| Audited and scored | 744 |
| Aborted with a logged reason | 162 |
| Crashed | 0 |
| Aborted without an explanation | 0 |

The per site outcome is in
[data/robustness_report.json](../data/robustness_report.json).

Completing means the tool handled the site, not that the site answered. None of
the 162 is the tool failing, but they do not all mean the same thing, and a
single number hides that:

| | Sites | What came back |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Refused deliberately | 107 | 100 x 403, and a handful of 401, 406, 451 and 202 challenge pages |
| Unavailable to this client | 45 | 19 timeouts, 12 connection errors, 11 x 429, and three 5xx |
| Gone | 10 | 9 x 404 and one 410 |

The middle row is the one to be careful with. Those forty-five may answer perfectly
for a reader on a different network, and nothing in this run proves otherwise.
The first row is a site turning away an automated client on purpose, usually
through a CDN or a bot manager.

**A 403 is not evidence that a site blocks AI crawlers.** A bot manager decides
on address reputation as much as on user agent, and refuses a browser from a data
centre just as readily. From outside you cannot separate an AI policy from an
infrastructure policy, so the tool reports the refusal and declines to interpret
it.

**HTTP 429 is ambiguous in both directions.** Seven of the eleven were traced to
three infrastructures, four to Vercel, two to istio-envoy and one to Cloudflare,
all of which rate limit by IP across every site they serve. So a 429 can mean the
site's policy or it can mean our own address. Re-checked hours after the run,
individually rather than in parallel, all seven still returned 429, which rules
out a burst from the recording but does not separate the two readings. They are
counted as aborted and excluded from any claim about a site.

## The answers are right

Every `robots.txt` in the corpus was read three ways and compared per agent,
21792 verdicts across the 681 sites that have a real one. Of the other 225, 162
never reached `robots.txt` and 34 returned a non-200 for it. The remaining 29
answered
with HTTP 200 and a body carrying no directives: five served markup instead of
`robots.txt`, including `linkedin.com`, which returned a reCAPTCHA challenge
page, and `abreu.pt`, which returned 68 KB of HTML; ten served an empty file;
and seven served a valid `text/plain` file of nothing but comments. Only the
first twelve are a site answering the wrong thing. The other seventeen are
legitimately permissive, and all twenty nine are treated the same way, as a site
with no rules.

- **the tool**
- **the Python standard library**, `urllib.robotparser`, on the raw file
- **a literal reader** written from RFC 9309, sharing no code with either

| | Agreement with the tool |
| --- | ---: |
| Literal reader | 100.00% |
| Standard library | 99.97% |

The seven standard library disagreements are all the same fault, and it is the
library's: it matches user agents by substring, so a site with a group named
`Fetch`, aimed at a download manager, has that group applied to
`Meta-ExternalFetcher`. The tool gets all seven right.

**Three implementations agreeing proves consistency, not correctness.** So the
work that actually establishes accuracy is done by hand, and this is where the
scale of it has to be stated honestly rather than rounded up.

289 scoring block verdicts across 63 sites were traced to the `robots.txt` group
that produced them, and none was unexplained. That pass was made when the
scoring buckets held eleven agents, in the 0.1.0 run. They now hold nineteen,
and this run counts 470 such verdicts across 67 sites, 253 in citation and 217
in user fetch. **The 181 the hand pass never reached carry the machine agreement
and nothing more.** They are not folded into the traced total, because a number
that mixes the two is worth less than either.

The same 67 sites also block training crawlers 561 times, which was not traced
by hand, because a training block earns and costs nothing and cannot move a
score. A separate sample of 25 sites the tool reports as fully open was checked
for false negatives and found clean.

That distinction is the point. An automated agreement rate is easy to produce and
easy to fool. The number worth trusting is the one a person checked.

The full comparison is in
[data/accuracy_report.json](../data/accuracy_report.json).

## It found three bugs in itself

This is the strongest evidence the validation is worth running, and each one
would have produced confidently wrong answers in the field.

**User agents matched by substring.** `protego`, which decides path questions
here, matches user agents the way Scrapy needs and this tool does not: it is
handed a whole `User-Agent` header, we hand it a bare product token. Wikipedia
has a group named `Fetch` that was being applied to `Meta-ExternalFetcher`, and
worse, any site writing `User-agent: bot` would have silently blocked GPTBot,
Googlebot, Bingbot, PerplexityBot, OAI-SearchBot and Claude-SearchBot in one
line. Group selection moved into `robots.py` using the prefix rule the
specification describes; `protego` still answers every path question.

**Groups declaring the same agent not merged.** One site declares `CCBot` twice
and contradicts itself, blocking it on one line and allowing it thirty two
lines later. We took the first group, the standard library took the last, and RFC 9309
section 2.2.1 says both are wrong: merge every group declaring the winning agent,
after which the two rules tie on length and Allow wins.

**A bare `Crawl-delay` closing nothing.** One site writes `User-agent: CCBot`
and a `Crawl-delay`, then `User-agent: AhrefsBot` and a `Crawl-delay`, then
`User-agent: Balihoo` and a `Disallow: /`. Only `Allow` and `Disallow` were
treated as ending a run of agent lines, so all three agents ran together into
one group and `CCBot` inherited a rule aimed at a marketing crawler. Any line
that is not a user-agent line closes the block.

All three are fixed, each with regression tests, and the independent reader was
corrected from the same paragraph of the specification rather than from making it
agree with us.

## The golden set

Thirty sites chosen because they are hard, replayed from fixtures committed to
this repository, and required to be exactly right.

The shapes covered: no `robots.txt` at all, a homepage served at `/robots.txt`,
a blanket `Disallow: /`, a blanket block that names exceptions, wildcards,
conflicting `Allow` and `Disallow`, Cloudflare generated files, `llms.txt`
present, nested sitemap indexes, a single page application, training blocked with
citation left open, and four different ways for a run to abort.

Every expectation in [data/golden_30.yaml](../data/golden_30.yaml) was traced by
hand to the `robots.txt` group that produced it. Two shapes from the original
list are absent, and both absences are findings rather than gaps in the search;
the file says which and why.

`pytest` runs the whole suite offline in under half a minute and never touches
the network.

## What this does not prove

**That the scores are the right scores.** The rubric is a set of weights chosen
by a person. What is validated here is that the tool applies them correctly and
consistently, not that a site scoring 80 deserves 80. The reasoning behind each
weight is in [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md), including two weaknesses it still has.

**That a site is or is not blocked at the edge.** The tool reads `robots.txt` and
markup. A site can pass every check and still return 403 to AI crawlers in
practice, and 100 sites in this run refused this one outright with a 403.

**That the heuristics are right about any individual site.** The JavaScript check
measures text volume and script weight rather than rendering, with thresholds
measured across 22 live pages and recorded in
[data/js_calibration.csv](../data/js_calibration.csv). The sectioning measure
uses thresholds from 12301 blocks across 868 pages, in
[data/block_calibration.csv](../data/block_calibration.csv). Both will misjudge
individual pages.

**That `robots.txt` says today what it said then.** These files change. Every
claim here is dated, and
[data/corpus_manifest.csv](../data/corpus_manifest.csv) carries the SHA-256 of
each one as it was read, so a change is visible rather than assumed.

**That blocking a fetcher achieves anything.** Six of the eight on demand
fetchers are documented by their own vendors as not honouring `robots.txt`. The
tool reports that plainly, and since 0.2.0 the rubric stops counting those
blocks, so a site is no longer marked down for a rule that does nothing.
[RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) carries the measurement that preceded the change.

## Reproducing it

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```bash
pytest
```

The offline suite, including the golden set of thirty. Under half a minute,
no network.

```bash
python scripts/refresh_fixtures.py --out tests/fixtures/corpus
```

Records the 906 sites. Touches the live web and takes about ninety minutes. The
fixtures are not committed, because 906 sites of real HTML is 342 MB and
truncating them was measured and rejected: at a 300 KB cap, 6 of 12 test domains
moved their Readability score.

```bash
python scripts/verify_accuracy.py --out data/accuracy_report.json
```

```bash
pytest -m slow
```

Replays all 906 offline, in ten to twenty minutes depending on the machine. Opt
in, because a slow
default is a suite people stop running.

## Checking the numbers without the fixtures

The 342 MB of recordings stay out of the repository, so the figures above rest on
files one machine holds. [data/corpus_manifest.csv](../data/corpus_manifest.csv)
is the part that fits: 906 rows, one per domain, each naming when it was read,
what the run did with it, and the SHA-256 of the `robots.txt` body. 710 domains
carry a hash; the other 196 either aborted before that point or answered
`/robots.txt` with a non-200. A hash records what came back rather than what it
should have been, so the pages that were not `robots.txt` are fingerprinted too.

One limit worth stating, because it is the kind of thing a manifest can hide. A
hash only proves a match for a file that is stable. `linkedin.com` returned a
challenge page carrying a per-request token, so that row will never report
`MATCH` however faithfully it was recorded. The row still fixes the size and the
date; it does not let you reproduce the body.

```bash
python scripts/verify_manifest.py --sample 25
```

Fetches those files now and reports `MATCH`, `CHANGED` or `UNREACHABLE` per
domain, hashing exactly the way the recording did. Name domains as arguments to
check specific ones. The sample is ordered by the SHA-256 of the domain, so it
is reproducible and cannot be steered towards the rows that happen to still
match. All 25 matched on 2026-08-30.

A `CHANGED` row is not a failure. Sites edit `robots.txt`, which is why every row
is dated. What the manifest rules out is a number that was never measured, and it
covers all 906 including the 162 that never scored, so nothing was quietly
dropped.

The hash is taken over the decoded body re-encoded as UTF-8, because recording
keeps text rather than bytes. The verifier applies the same normalisation, which
is why it is a script and not a paragraph asking you to guess.

```bash
python scripts/build_manifest.py
```

Rebuilds the manifest from the recordings. It should reproduce the committed file
byte for byte.
