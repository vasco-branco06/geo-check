"""User fetch crawlers allowed. 20 points.

These retrieve a single page when someone pastes a link into an assistant or
asks about a URL. Six of the eight are documented by their own vendors as not
honouring robots.txt, so a Disallow aimed at them changes nothing in practice
and no longer changes the score either.

Until 0.2.0 every one of them counted, and a site lost points for a block that
did not work. The rubric had said in writing that this was wrong before it was fixed.
Replaying the corpus put a number on it: of 744 scored sites, 61 block at least
one of these agents, 53 scored differently once ineffective blocks stopped
counting, and 26 of those changed letter grade.
