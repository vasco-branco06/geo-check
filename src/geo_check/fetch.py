"""HTTP layer.

Rules, from the scaffold and kept:
  - Identify honestly in the user agent, with a link to the repository. This
    tool reads robots.txt for a living, it does not get to pretend to be a
    browser.
  - Never raise on a network problem. Return a typed failure with a reason, so
    the 906 site robustness run can log it instead of crashing.
  - Timeouts on every request. One slow site must not hang the run.
  - Follow redirects, but record the final URL.

The body is read in chunks against a byte ceiling. A timeout bounds how long a
single read may block, not how much a site may send, and a slow drip of a very
large response would otherwise stall a sweep across hundreds of unknown hosts.
