"""The 906 site robustness run, replayed offline.

CLAUDE.md asks for above 95 percent completing, with the rest failing for a
logged reason. Failing with a reason counts as the tool working: a site behind a
bot manager cannot be audited by anyone, and saying so is the honest result.

These fixtures are not in the repository. 906 sites of real HTML is 342 MB, and
truncating the pages was measured and rejected, because at a 300 KB cap 6 of 12
domains changed their Readability score. So the corpus fixtures are recorded
locally and this file skips when they are absent. The golden set, which is
committed, is what a fresh clone runs.

Record them with:

    python scripts/refresh_fixtures.py --out tests/fixtures/corpus \
        --report data/robustness_report.json
